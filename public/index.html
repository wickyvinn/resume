		  <p>## leisure ##</p>
		  	My buddy Glen and I write short stories together, which we hide <a href="http://thebunkum.tumblr.com">here</a>.
		  	I swim but lately have been paying a lot more attention to my new mistress, rock climbing. My poisons are cigars and scotch. If you do anything of these things, holler because I'd love to have you as a buddy.

		   I hail from UC Berkeley's Math and English departments (2006-2010), then <a href="http:www.hackbrightacademy.com">Hackbright Academy</a>, where I learned how to code properly (Summer 2013). 
		   <p>Nowadays, I spend most of my time writing in Scala for the platform team at <a href="http://www.versal.com">Versal.com</a>, an open publishing platform for anyone to create interactive online courses (2013-). </p>
		   <p>Before that I was a resarch manager at a finance services company called <a href="http://www.glasslewis.com">Glass Lewis & Co.</a>, where I designed databases and built data visualization tools using Python and MySQL (2010-2013).</p>
		   <p>I spent a summer in Cairo teaching Southern Sudanese refugee children English and Algebra while their nation eagerly awaited the results of the referendum for seceding. They were super cute, and some essays cataloging my experiences can be found <a href="/cairo">here</a> (Summer 2010).

	1. be able to grab contents of json file.
	2. 

	// ideas
	1. clicking on each section will send you to a new page. animattion
	2. new page will contain details - a further description of it
		a. ie for UC Berkeley, next page will be an abstract of my woody allen thesis, for christ sake acapella group, and cairo trip
		b. maybe a timeline that shows different years, and hovering over each 'milestone', text description is exposed (perhaps a fade into text), and zooms to better font while everything else shrinks in font. 
		b2. it would be hard to expose videos, or whatever if i want to do this. 
		b3.
